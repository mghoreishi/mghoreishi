### Hi, I'm Maryam Ghoreishi 👋

For over 8 years my passion has been creating software applications for small to enterprise-sized companies.

I've been honored to have participated in several successful projects as a .NET Developer. I've been fortunate enough to work with the best developers in my country. 
I have a great passion for writing clean and testable codes. I have a special passion for trying to find the best ways to solve my problems in the projects.

Currenty I'm developing a social network project for a German startup, It's based on .net core and microservice, also it's based on a uniq idea, It has been completed and has entered the testing and debugging phase. So I'm looking for a new job as a Back-end .NET Developer with visa sponsorship.

Most of my ability to write code comes from my work with some of the best software development companies. I've had the privilege of coding with the best programming teams and gaining different knowledge for writing applications. I've used this distinction to deliver consistent positive results and help companies continually grow and develop.
