### Hi, I'm Maryam Ghoreishi 👋

Innovative, with a tendency to think outside the box and strive for excellence. Relentless when challenged—never gives up until an efficient, secure, yet simple solution is found.

For over eight years, my passion has been creating software applications for small to enterprise-sized companies.

I've been honored to participate in several successful projects as a .NET Developer and fortunate to work with some of the best developers. I have a strong passion for writing clean, testable code and continuously seeking the best ways to solve project challenges.

Currently, I am developing a comprehensive cloud-based travel ERP system on Microsoft Azure to automate group operations, itineraries, contracts, and finances—significantly boosting efficiency and simplifying workflows for a leading B2B tour operator in Northern Europe.

In my previous job, I developed a social network project for a Dutch startup. It was built using .NET Core and a microservices architecture, based on a unique concept. The project was successfully completed and published on Google Play and the App Store.

Much of my coding ability comes from working with top software development companies. I have had the privilege of coding alongside some of the best programming teams, gaining diverse knowledge in application development. I've used this experience to consistently deliver positive results and contribute to companies' growth and innovation.
